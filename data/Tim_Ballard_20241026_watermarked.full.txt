 Hey guys, Trigger Warning for what we're about to show you. You're going to see raw footage, undercover footage from a historic case in Colombia that was the inspiration behind Sound of Freedom, what the traffickers, including convicted child trafficker Kelly Sloris Moia, actually said, is worse than what you see in Sound of Freedom. That's why I'm giving you this trigger warning. It's very important that truth get out. Enjoy the video. What he was actually doing was assaulting her everywhere. The irony of all this is that the victim is the trafficker. The 11th of October 2014, the country was surprised with an operation against the abuse sexual in a case of infantil prostitution discovered in Cartagena, the integrants of the group of proxies were captured and convicted. This October, their convicted were ratified by the above-carriage tribunal, only one of them was released. The others, as we see here, Kelly Johanna Suarez Moia, Juan Manuel, Oquendo Sierra, Alias Fuego, Samuel David Olave, Eduardo Ortegaiza, will have to pay 16-year-old convicted prisoners. The operation to dismantle this organization lasted several months, including the infiltration of agents of the Fiscalía and an ex agent of the FBI dedicated to fight against these groups. We had access to the investigation and the videos that were recorded in a scandalous and lamentable way, such as the minor of age were offered to foreigners. This informer contains some images and images, as you can see here, which are perturbators. All the images that we are going to show you are real images of operative speech. This is exclusive from Nauticia Caraco. The scene is a bit too much, and I'm going to do it. It's too much, I'll put it there. This is one of the most absurd parts of the way, as a band in Cartagena negotiated children to prostitutes. In this occasion, the offer was to foreigners. A scandal is negotiated that was not only verbal, but that were interested in the proposal to the Cartagena as these. There were foreigners who could see photos of those who would be their children or children. Sexual slaves changed money that would pay to the men who made them the offer. To have them there, they were caught by a false agency of models. Well, the first step was what they asked us in the Fiscalía. The Fiscalía was, please, that they go to the White House. And not just to see if it's true that they are soliciting the gringos that are there. We went there, we sat down for about 20 minutes, we had a chair, not asking for anything, not looking for anything, but sitting there and and we arrived a man who, as he said, as we call, and I have children for sex, they are injured. What Natrata Inbalar, one of the infiltrated people in the operation, was recorded in this video. What you are going to hear is the way how that day they offered children to have sex. This was the starting point of the investigation. Valar, an ex agent of the FBI that has dedicated the last years to infiltrate this type of organizations in Latin America, came to Colombia to be part of the operation Crystal 2. The other protagonist was this man, the Colombian agent who is the operator. What is the next step in the operation? Well, identify people. Identify people, see what kind of activity, activity, what kind of role, of each one is a little bit. So we were meeting the most members. The step that took place after this man, Juan Manuel, who closes the fire, someone opened the door of the organization to the point that 15 days after the operation in the beach, invited all the agents infiltrated to his house, where the issue was again the sexual abuse of menories. It is considered considered by the investigators in open as the most dangerous because they were in the territory of the criminals, it was also recorded. This that is being seen was what happened in that apartment. How do you call? They already have a 12-year-old sister, they want to take her. They are organized. They will help a 12-year-old sister. I will not talk to her. She says $ 1000. Or more. I want to see her well to pay $ 1000. Despite the efforts and the proposals that they planned to do until that moment, the agents in cover, they did not yet know the children and the children that the group were offering, however they were threatened in the negotiation and to do it, they organized a new meeting with the professionals, this time in a place chosen by the investigators. A place that we controlled, then we went to the restaurant in Cartagena in the beach and we put cameras well placed and from there we started to talk more details. And this was the record that the cameras did that day, or enough so that the meetings and the streets of the participants will be fully identified. These are girls that aren't super experienced because they are little girls. So try to have a little bit of a delicate, delicate look at them. The only woman in the table is the same as the apartment, Kelly Johan, Suarez Mulla, one of the candidates for the independence in 2013, she did not win, but she achieved a figure that was looking for. And then she arrived, that Suarez with the answer, she finished, what she said so far, and I say that she has been selected, please, and begins to play, while she is eating. I'm going to say that I'm a little bit innocent and that you are going to be the witness. Okay, thank you, we have other things that we have to talk about. With the trust of the organization in the hands, a dark proposal of the criminals who surprised the investigators and left the ambition of the money they had, the construction of a hotel. A hotel that is not sold by girls. Despite the initial surprise the investigators continued to play and they started talking about the investment in the hotel. A few days later, a party was organized to celebrate the birthday of one of the infiltrators, and as a proof of trust, the president of the president offered the place where he was going to build the hotel. There was also before the party, they pretended to close the deal. In the form of the one I was offering and that they had, the package completely was planned, the operation was planned or a party. And that party was in an island near the city of Cartagena. To demonstrate their economic capacity, of course, the investors decided to run with the guests of the party and take advantage of the circumstances to arrive first with the food and liquor and drink, and spend the same time with cameras and microphones to register the business, a business where for the first time and they were going to see the children and that became the final point of the negotiation. All the follow-up and the crew of the registrar who made the agents infiltrated during the months that the operation took place, and finally, that allowed the dismantling of the proximate. The fiscal year, the national armed migration, the Colombia, the ONG of Timbalar and the family came together to rescue the 54 minority who were being negotiated. In the island here, very close to Varu, in the island, the coquette, as we see it, in this map. What you will see next, corresponds to everything that happened in that island and the operation launched by Colombian authorities. The operation was completed as planned. The migration, Colombia, the armed and the ISEBF, disembarked a little bit after the proximate band had presented the children to the supposed clients who were actually agents in cover and personal of the foundation of Timbalar that collaborated for Colombian fiscal year. Just like in the previous meetings, this was also recorded. Before they were surprised by the operation. The cameras recorded the first contact of the foreigners with the children and the children. They were 54, but only a few were carried out before the group of the United States. In評zial, came to disbug their lives as long as was not average.� forgiving hesitation. He was beaten up to the inc markets and he was expelled from jail. Still beautiful. Wow. I remember I get good stuff. That's that bien. What I was looking for in these minor traffickers was so clear that they reiterated it one and another. That's why it's so important. But one question. What for? For all of us to be clear. This is very cool. It's a gift for them to have sex. It's a gift from one of them. Yes, but the child of 11. Yes, the child also. But it's a gift from a child. You know, it's a gift from a child. It's a gift from a child. With all the details of the foreigners and the foreigners, they agreed on the other business. The construction of the hotel where they were looking for commercializing sexual minorities like these. It was so clear that one of them defined what they were looking for. But because they were here, there were a lot of classrooms. Here it's here. It's being built by a family of legal. But I think we're going to do some legal. And among those illegal things that they pretended to do, they described the process they would do with children and children. It was a price for each one. I think. And they were those who fixed the prices. I remember that they said they had a price of 12 years. For $1,000, they were going to do this. Others were going to do another price. They were talking about each one. What price would they have depending on the sexual act they were going to do? As part of the operation, the agents in cover always tried to stop the children. They were preparing any un-controlable act at the time of the high school. That's why they achieved that 54 children were in this chaos, the situation of the criminals and the agents in cover, they went to the business. What did the exact thing take to cover the operation? And why are we here today? That took place for October 10th. October 2014. On Saturday, we went to the personal and best of the investigation. We were aware of that. Here, in this place, we needed the minimum of data. Obviously, the criminal gang, who was there, was receiving or organizing to be able to transport them. The route of an hour that took place was the minimum of data to arrive to the private island where the operating device was developed. We are going to the same time as hours later, when the agents were infiltrated, they were given a part of the money for the two businesses, the hotel and children, and the children were released from the high school. When the Delito was consumed, the operation began for water. Once the Delincuentes reduced, the attempt of the subordinates failed to dissolve the agents of the facility. No, no, silence. Silence. No. I'm not with him. He's recording everything. I'm offering money. I have the money. Help me please. A situation that I had a different response to the reiteration that everyone was detained. Please, please, read the letter of the capture. While the ZD was finished by the adults, the group of the ICBF kept the children. The capture of the two minors is the number of the people with the big ones. Yes. I have to tell you that the old man was released. Despite the fact that everyone knew the role that had played until this time the queen, that Lilluana, tried to convince the investigators that it was innocent. I'm not with him. I'm not with him. I'm with him. Please. According to her, it was only through the pass. However, in her place, the agents of the CTIF found a woman who contained details that called her attention. Lilluana, the couple is dead. It was a person who said that the pass is dead and that the number of 30 people was found. The number seems so important that someone gave the task to break those pages before the trial arrived to the trial. As the investigators were trying to get the news to Caracol. What was the most painful moment? At the moment, if the personal address was going to be, I would say that I was a little bit of a tumor. When we were captured, I was also a tumor. I was injured in the skin, I was injured in the skin that we were doing. That was one of the most painful moments. The fear of this agent was because they were here and the CTIF didn't know the role they were accomplishing. At the end, five captured were all the members of the band. Ten years later, the Tribunal, the top of the Cartagena, confirmed the sentence that imposed a game to 16 years of each one. Only one of them was solved. However, despite the firm's condition, all are free for termination and now the mission of the recommendations to capture them so that they can be filled with their foam. Ten years later, Tim Balar, ex agent of the FBI decided to infiltrate himself to collaborate in the dismantling of this organization looking back and explaining why he decided to do it. I was a special agent, as a federal investigator of two countries, doing investigations on the deal and the exploitation of children. We started a plan of how we could infiltrate the challenges that they created that existed. So, I decided to do something that many people thought was crazy. According to official figures in the last four years, about 400 children have been induced to the constitution in our country. The operation is the evidence of the way as every day there are children and children induced to the constitution, used illegally with sexual fines. This is 400-menoried victims that have been induced to the constitution to separate only official figures that have been announced. The official figures, according to authorities, can be even greater. The fragility of these children and children was the operation of the operation of the Crystal, which also inspired the sound of freedom. Tomorrow we will meet the report of one of the biggest victims of the year, and that was rescued in the middle of this operation. Today, Pedro is in exile, since he has risen to the danger by the constant threats that he has received to counter his testimony.
